# CryptApp
Simple cryptography desktop app done to challenge myself. 
There are two functions in this app, the first is to encrypt text and the second is to decrypt message.

My aim in the future is to improve upon the existing application. The idea is to improve the cipher I created to be more robust 
and obviously adjust the decrypt message upon each improvment I have done to the encryption process.

My next big step is to take this from a Windows form to a web application.

If you have any questions or suggestions please don't hesitate to contact me.
